I don't really write. I don't really write at all. I barely even communicate. So I apologize in advance if this comes off as somewhat "all over the place".
Things have gotten quite dire with my life and me and as of recently, my singular source of interpersonal communication that is not work-related has been..."*terminated*".

And I feel like things will take a very depressing turn if I don't at least pretend I am talking with someone...about something. Even if I won't get any replies, just as fine with me. And that's, for the most part, why I am trying to at least dump some thoughts on this site. They will likely be about technical projects or things I want to explore more rather than about personal things, that's what therapists are for amirite. 

But I also hope that, having written those things down, will give me a clearer and more structured image as to what I want to do in my free time and how to approach it. Because, god knows, I am currently jumping from one stimulant-infused 4-nights-no-sleep bender into the next after well some well deserved 20 hour naps inbetween. And that's not really a lifestyle my body will tolerate for long. Plus, I am starting to doubt I am even that productive after the first 40 hours lol. If I remember correctly, I have tried to set up a basic first article around 20 times before giving up because my perfectionist mind was always displeased with SOMETHING. Even now, it bothers me that I haven't configured the KaTeX plugin even if I don't have any purpose for it.

In addition to those primary reasons, another major incentive was for me getting more into the world of self-hosting services. A Kavita instance I am running locally   and that I would like to access from outside has gotten me interested in the idea. Even this website, running currently on Netlify should ideally be hosted by yours truly. I should bite the bullet and buy some more hardware finally.

Anyways, a small static website seemed like a good fit from which to gradually branch out over time. I also want to have a place where I potentially rant about tech stuff or even showcase personal pet projects I have been and will be working on. I got a lotta stuff cookin'.

For my own peace of mind I want to keep a slow but steady curve when it comes to upgrades on this site. My focus for tomorrow:
- LaTeX support
- Simple **About** page

I don't really know what else to say at this moment, maybe I will get better at this whole writing-thing over time. Maybe not. :^)
***Cya!***
