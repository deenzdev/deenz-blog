"Wait, maybe. I think maybe I'm just like a little bizarre little person who walks back and forth. Whatever, you know..."

I really have nothing to complain about…because all things considered, when looking at my life from an outside perspective, it must seem like I am in a perfect position to kickstart whatever aspect of my existence I want to right now (disregarding the fact that I am rapidly approaching 29 fml).

I have a stable job & career in a field that usually brings me joy and in which I can continously find things that interest me. I am in fairly good shape with no pressing health conditions that require addressing. I have no financial responsibilities aside from rent and car insurance. No responsibilities in general whatsoever resulting in copious amounts of free time. Time that is heavily underutilized. I could do anything, I could travel anywhere (within reason). There’s no one to answer to. And yet…

...it all lacks purpose without you.

Last weekend I have tried my damndest to find a workable solution for setting up a mail server without the need of port forwarding. But from a technical perspective, it seems like it’s impossible if I don’t want to traverse the route of hosting it on a VPS which would defeat the purpose of this whole project in the first place.

It’s really nothing major, I have numerous random ideas and when I aim to follow up on all of them there’s bound to be some that are not feasible as of right now but after a couple weeks of writing code like a maniac, coming to a random standstill like that has snapped me out of the flow or maybe **trance**(?) I was in and suddenly, I am here again and here is not with her.
I am fundamentally, practically, and in every possible sense of the word alone. And the only person that’s given me a reprief of that realization is gone, rather “is going” and I can just sit here watching them fade away slowly but surely. It goes without saying that everything is entirely my fault but that’s besides the point.

I don’t really like people nor am I too fond of conversations. And I am in the priviliged and unfortunate position where I can fully induldge in that notion. I can live my life perfectly well without engaging or challenging it. And I have managed to enjoy my time by myself just fine for the vast majority of my adult life. But after having met and talked to this person for a little over a year my entire queue of priorities has shifted dramatically. Because I **did** enjoy our conversations. In fact, they meant more to me than I thought anything ever could. And their presence has provided me with a genuine sense of happiness and comfort that no one else’s ever has. And now it’s likely over. Still in the process of “overing”, I guess.

For a few months now. And I think it’s getting worse. I am getting worse. And all I can do is cope and sneed about it. Either mindlessly gobbling up media at any and all times or using stimulants to shift every sense I have towards work/programming.

God forbid an independent thought is forming because it will inevitably be about her…

There’s nothing to do. I try. I swear I am. Trying to find purpose within myself but I just can't. Which is why I absolutely **cannot** afford to be taken out of my flow. I’ll find other small project ideas for this site & my home server setup and I can bury myself in my work and just...run away? But I have already faced it all. And it changes nothing. Whatever. Maybe it’s finally time to invest in a Raspberry Pi. I’ve read an article about this mini pc case which seems fairly neat and offers support for an NVME.

That way I could finally shift my stupid containers and book libraries from my work or personal machine to a dedicated host. Could serve as a neat file server as well. Shoutout to copyparty for being a turbo based project that I can’t wait to integrate.

{{< github repo="9001/copyparty" showThumbnail=true >}}

But I will have to do a bit of research before because I am not entirely sure what the constraints of ARM systems are in terms of my plans and ideas.

As for more immediate plans? If nothing horrible happens, I’ll delve into methods to probe my site and services for basic security misconfigurations tonight. I’ll try to document everything and maybe I’ll get out 2 posts in a single day…wouldn’t that be crazy?
