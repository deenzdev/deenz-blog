### Intro
Heyhey!!!
Soooo, somehow you have found your way to this site. I can't really tell how...***well, I can***.
Surely somewhere among these thousands of data center DNS queries there must be some unique entry pointing right at you. It's over for you, kid.

But that aside, there's no reason someone should be here other than me. Regardless, if you're reading this...I appreciate it.
I don't feel like I have many chances to talk or or *be heard* as cringe as that may sound. I guess it's one of those basic human needs everyone takes for granted, that SHOULD be taken for granted maybe. I don't really know.
I'll stop whining for now. :^)

Anyway, let's get to it!
### About me, for real tho
My name is Dennis and I'm some random 28 year old from the Internet gainfully employed as a Backend Software Engineer...or Developer, if you have a horse in that race.

I'd like to think that I am a relatively laid back kinda fella. I don't take myself too seriously and I hope I am somewhat self-aware as well? I am not so sure anymore these days.

Some other shrimple facts about me:
- I love marine critters of all kinds, especially the cetacean ones
- contrary to that, I very much like to go fishing when the mood strikes me
- I am playing the piano at a semi-amateur level, getting a lot more practice in recently
- I like to travel whenever I get the chance, I used to at least...and the current list of countries I have been to at one point or another comprises: ***Italy, USA, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand, Australia, UK, Poland*** and surely some other EU shithole I can't remember 
- I overuse profanity....
- I am easily made to be excited about a topic if I sense the other to be excited about it
- I tend to rotate through a slowly growing list of subjects that interest me, picking up where I left off last time usually including such things as Cryptography, Nuclear Engineering, Marine Biology, Geology... ,Kaijiu movies, the field of Military aviation, Linguistics, reading genre-fiction slop, reading highbrow *Literature*, Digital Signal Processing.

I guess I should mention Computer Science as well, huh...meh...
Nah, just kidding. I am genuinely passionate about a metric fuckton of CS related topics. From Data Science to DevOps to Computer Hardware Architecture, File Transfer Protocols and Reverse Engineering. As long as it's not some pesky UI shit I am likely into it. (Not to say I can't appreciate a well designed Interface, it just won't be designed by me lol).

I have spent too many years of my adult life denying myself that excitement of tech thinking that I couldn't possibly dare to fall into this stereotype of being the quiet, lonely loser who ***OF FUCKING COURSE*** works in IT.
But after embracing it, I can say that I have finally found an appropriate outlet for a lot of aimlessness I have experienced before.


> At this point I should probably point out that I have no degree in this field. God knows how I survived high school. Any current and future career success I  can proudly attribute to a whole lot of...luck, I guess. I don't know. But I won't question it. ***God's plan!***

Hmmm, what else is there...
I suppose I can insert some corny Favorites section just to fill the Table of Contents (do I have that even enabled?!). Keep in mind, this is not a be-all-end-all selection...just whatever feels *right* in this very moment which is also why I am not spending any time elaborating on those choices. That and I am too lazy rn...

### Outro (for now)
I don't really feel like continuing this right now!! But I have already written up more than I initially expected. So you should be grateful, witless visitor.
Maybe I can make it a weekly habit to add some more information that isn't too indidentifiable but then again, at the time of writing I have my name plastered on the front page so who's the real nimrod?! Anyways...<br>
**CYA!**
:^)

...ok, maybe I'll play around with the shortcodes quickly that this framework supplies...
