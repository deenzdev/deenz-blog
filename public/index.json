I don\u0026rsquo;t really write at all. I barely even communicate. So I apologize in advance if this comes off as somewhat \u0026ldquo;all over the place\u0026rdquo;. Things have gotten quite dire with my life and me and as of recently, my singular source of interpersonal communication that is not work-related has been\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;terminated\u0026quot;.\nAnd I feel like things will take a very depressing turn if I don\u0026rsquo;t at least pretend I am talking with someone\u0026hellip;about something. Even if I won\u0026rsquo;t get any replies, just as fine with me. And that\u0026rsquo;s, for the most part, why I am trying to at least dump some thoughts on this site. They will likely be about technical projects or things I want to explore more rather than about personal things, that\u0026rsquo;s what therapists are for amirite.\nBut I also hope that, having written those things down, will give me a clearer and more structured image as to what I want to do in my free time and how to approach it. Because, god knows, I am currently jumping from one stimulant-infused 4-nights-no-sleep bender into the next after well some well deserved 20 hour naps inbetween. And that\u0026rsquo;s not really a lifestyle my body will tolerate for long. Plus, I am starting to doubt I am even that productive after the first 40 hours lol. If I remember correctly, I have tried to set up a basic first article around 20 times before giving up because my perfectionist mind was always displeased with SOMETHING. Even now, it bothers me that I haven\u0026rsquo;t configured the KaTeX plugin even if I don\u0026rsquo;t have any purpose for it.\nIn addition to those primary reasons, another major incentive was for me getting more into the world of self-hosting services. A Kavita instance I am running locally and that I would like to access from outside has gotten me interested in the idea. Even this website, running currently on Netlify should ideally be hosted by yours truly. I should bite the bullet and buy some more hardware finally.\nAnyways, a small static website seemed like a good fit from which to gradually branch out over time. I also want to have a place where I potentially rant about tech stuff or even showcase personal pet projects I have been and will be working on. I got a lotta stuff cookin'.\nFor my own peace of mind I want to keep a slow but steady curve when it comes to upgrades on this site. My focus for tomorrow:\nLaTeX support Simple About page I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what else to say at this moment, maybe I will get better at this whole writing-thing over time. Maybe not. :^) Cya!\n","date":"4 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/a670dacb96c2-i-m-here....and-ya-ll-there/","section":"Posts","summary":"Just a short stream of thoughts as to why I am here and why this site exists in the first place.","title":"I'm here....and ya'll there!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
