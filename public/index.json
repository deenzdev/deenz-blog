I have not yet gone to bed and I think I am past the 100h threshold or at least very close to it. That\u0026rsquo;s where the \u0026ldquo;fun stuff\u0026rdquo; tends to happen. :^) But I wanna start off linking a video I have been obsessed with recently:\nPURE UNFILTERED 100% FLOURIDE FREE SOVL Goes hard, right?! Well, as I was saying\u0026hellip;.I spent the majority of the evening looking into getting this site indexed through google struggling quite a bit with their claim my robots.txt was blocking those poor Googlebots out but I could verifiably check the file myself right then and there and it allowed basically everything and everyone. I dismissed it as a matter of caching, that\u0026rsquo;s essentially become my go-to excuse for any tech-related issue recently. And honestly, do I really that much about being exposed to even more bots and and fake queries muddying my metrics?! Surely not.\nRegardless, I went and explored the rest of the Google Search Console site out of curiosity. It seemed fairly empty, a lot of space wasted on what might one day be a plethora of glistening dashboards displaying the tens of dozens of visitors I could have. If I just keep my head in the game, that is. One other \u0026ldquo;source of interactivity\u0026rdquo; was the the field to have my ´sitemap.xml´ analyzed. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite sure what analyzed meant in that context but I thought it couldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt. I haven\u0026rsquo;t touched it myself or any of the related options so maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll get some good insight into something, at least.\nTurns out that the vast majority of generated files in the public directory, and that incldues the sitemap as well, declare my baseURL as http://localhost:1313. Madness. And why haven\u0026rsquo;t I bothered flushing that whole public folder by now. What the fuck is wrong with me\u0026hellip;That\u0026rsquo;s easy!\nI\u0026rsquo;m just kinda really fucking stupid sometimes (シ_ _)シ me for the first 8h of my shift And so, my designated task for the day would be: Cleaning out the public directory, not break the site and maybe bring a modicum more order into things. And as these things tend to go with me, this small little chore quickly expanded into the idea of: HEY, why don\u0026rsquo;t implement an actual CI/CD pipeline instead of awkwardly juggling the local files in my inventory. And HEY, why don\u0026rsquo;t I move these static files into a Docker container too instead of having them on my godforsaken Desktop\u0026hellip;\nAnd HEYYYY, what if I automate the building process, flush the public directory, containerize my website\u0026rsquo;s code alongside the nginx server and build an image from them, then tag it properly and push it to the DockerHub registry and then regularly have my running docker compose instance somehow pull that image new image and subsitute the outdated one with that???? What then, huh???\n\u0026#x1f4a1; Tip: Only take medication you have been prescribed by a licensed physician.\nI mean, in the grand scheme of things it\u0026rsquo;s really not that outlandish, maybe only the part where\u0026hellip;again, this is about 5MB of crude Markdown and copyright protected images that will probably get me in hot water soon enough lo but oh well\u0026hellip;It\u0026rsquo;s not so much about whether it makes sense or not and more so about whether I can make this happen in my current fugue state. (Spoiler: I can, yeah!)\nThe biggest challenge, if I am being honest, consisted of shutting out all the gitlab-ci.yml syntax I have been working with at my job for the past couple weeks. I have come to really love automation in this context. It\u0026rsquo;s all very sensibly structured, the language makes sense, it\u0026rsquo;s satisfying seeing multiple chained jobs turn green one after another. And I had kinda expected that a lot of the syntax carried over between the two git services and sure, they both have \u0026ldquo;jobs\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;I guess. But the fuck are GitHub ACTIONS??? What a stupid name for a CI/CD platform. When I think of a seamless strand of interwoven processes, the last word that comes to mind is ACTIONS.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know, it\u0026rsquo;s likely just a matter of having been used to different conventions for so long, I\u0026rsquo;m being a pissbaby. Which is funny considering that I used GitHub for considerably longer than GitLab. Well, time to write my own VCS so I stop complaining aha! God no\u0026hellip;At least not anytime soon.\nIn GitHub\u0026rsquo;s defense, I always really liked their UI and it gives me more of a feeling of being \u0026ldquo;in control\u0026rdquo; than the GitLab one has done so far. That might be because my lack of admin privileges on our on-premise instance might obfuscate a lot of the functionality but I consistently feel like I am missing something or forgot something in the ether that is GitLab, many things are just too tucked away. Perhaps an incentive to utilize the GitLab API and work on some centralized dashboard where I can see all the reviewed merge requests I have forgotten about. (Graphana use case real?)\nNevertheless, I got to work. The nice thing when working on personal projects is the opportunity to only focus on functionality. I mean, you can\u0026rsquo;t really mess up that much structurally in a YAML file anyways but I don\u0026rsquo;t find myself checking trailing whitespace over and over again. I know my IDE should do that by itself but I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to click that checkbox yet bro chill\u0026hellip;Feel free to check my crap (BUT FUNCTIONAL) code yourself, it should be inside .github/workflows/github-workflow.yml.\ndekaratas/deenz-blog HTML 0 0 The only notable section is how GitHub seemingly handles environments and environment variables/secrets. There seem to be very clear distinctions between them all and different contexts\u0026hellip;and I am not quite sure how I actually got the docker login command to recognize both values finally after a good half hour but I am not complaining. AND DON\u0026rsquo;T TELL ME TO READ THE DOCS. I read the docs. They\u0026rsquo;re very short worded when it comes to this particular topic. Very few good examples. But oh well, I figured it out. :^) Ohh, and deciphering what damn Docker registry I have to log into was also a lot of guess work. I hope to have a more surefire way to determine that in the future. (I am likely just being stupid\u0026hellip;) but I will definitely update this part when I hear something, even just for my own sake.\nAs you can see, all that pipeline really does is utilize some variables to build both the static files from the hugo directory and a tagged docker image in accordance to this stupidly simplistic Dockerfile.\n# Stage 1: Build Hugo site FROM hugomods/hugo:reg-node-0.148.2 AS builder WORKDIR /site COPY . . RUN hugo --minify -b https://www.deenzcan.com # Stage 2: Serve with Nginx FROM nginx:alpine RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/\\* COPY --from=builder /site/public /usr/share/nginx/html EXPOSE 80 CMD [\u0026#34;nginx\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-g\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;daemon off;\u0026#34;] I haven\u0026rsquo;t spun up too many instances of nginx myself in the past but what I failed to provide is a more customized .config file. Something I definitely want to look into tomorrow when I am done with work. Ultimately, it all does what it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to do which is what matters\u0026hellip;\nTO MEEEEEE And also to my steadily growing docker-compose.yml. The actual core of my work if you will.\nservices: blog: container_name: deenz-blog image: deenzdev/deenz-blog-images labels: - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=deenz ports: - \u0026#34;9000:80\u0026#34; restart: unless-stopped watchtower: image: containrrr/watchtower container_name: watchtower volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock environment: - WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL=30 - WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true - WATCHTOWER_INCLUDE_RESTARTING=true - WATCHTOWER_SCOPE=deenz restart: unless-stopped This little blog section had to be adjusted somewhat to dictate a scope for the Watchtower service. That one is pretty much responsible for what I had suggested earlier. It keeps a steady on your container group and will, if so configured, in regular intervals pull a new docker image, compare versions and switch them out before you can even notice. It\u0026rsquo;s really nifty and you should chceck out the documentation , faceless reader\u0026hellip;if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in it.\nSo, after messing around with some folder on my desktop being the source of my site, I am quite proud to have a reproducible pipeline that will store cleaned up ready-to-run containers of it at different points in time. Kinda cool!! Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve said. I\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for automation lol.\nAlright, this has been way too much. I will try to keep myself shorter in the future. For the next few days I SWEAR, I\u0026rsquo;ll take it a bit easier. Just gotta get through the workday bros. Just gotta get through another day. Just gotta get to the end of the week my guys\u0026hellip;.Ok, CYA!!! :^)\n","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/10586afc4c14-i-m-on-that-docker-in-docker-typa-shit-bruh/","section":"Posts","summary":"Another unforeseen and self imposed task accomplished to a degree that actually leaves me satisfied.","title":"I'm on that Docker in Docker typa shit bruh and thats on god","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/insomnia/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Insomnia","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/the-site/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"The-Site","type":"tags"},{"content":" Intro # Heyhey!!!

I am easily made to be excited about a topic if I sense the other to be excited about it I tend to rotate through a slowly growing list of subjects that interest me, picking up where I left off last time usually including such things as Cryptography, Nuclear Engineering, Marine Biology, Geology\u0026hellip; ,Kaijiu movies, the field of Military aviation, Linguistics, reading genre-fiction slop, reading highbrow Literature, Digital Signal Processing. I guess I should mention Computer Science as well, huh\u0026hellip;meh\u0026hellip; Nah, just kidding. I am genuinely passionate about a metric fuckton of CS related topics. From Data Science to DevOps to Computer Hardware Architecture, File Transfer Protocols and Reverse Engineering. As long as it\u0026rsquo;s not some pesky UI shit I am likely into it. (Not to say I can\u0026rsquo;t appreciate a well designed Interface, it just won\u0026rsquo;t be designed by me lol).\nI have spent too many years of my adult life denying myself that excitement of tech thinking that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly dare to fall into this stereotype of being the quiet, lonely loser who OF FUCKING COURSE works in IT. But after embracing it, I can say that I have finally found an appropriate outlet for a lot of aimlessness I have experienced before.\nAt this point I should probably point out that I have no degree in this field. God knows how I survived high school. Any current and future career success I can proudly attribute to a whole lot of\u0026hellip;luck, I guess. I don\u0026rsquo;t know.

But one thing led to another. My thoughts started to wander to places best left buried for now. (Hahaha, I miss her, bros\u0026hellip;) So, I had to distract myself whilst waiting for wagie hour to begin again.\nThus, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a little glimpse (strictly for future planning) into how much domains go for these days. Can\u0026rsquo;t hurt to familiarize myself with these things, two weeks ago I had never even thought about running something as pitiful as a blog ha! Well, turns out\u0026hellip;this shit is dirt cheap.\nAs you can hopefully see, non-existant reader\u0026hellip;I had to go for it. There was no other option\u0026hellip;and so one thing led to another. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to describe the Odysee that followed to the best of my ability but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to reconstruct the exact steps. I will also note down explanations for a few terms, mostly for myself. That\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a reoccurring thing.\nEssentially, I had very little idea how long the whole process would take nor did I have any specific plans to actually utilize this domain for the forseeable future but 4,99/year is hard to beat. Well, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s actually easy to beat. It\u0026rsquo;s truly crazy how cheap these things are.\nSo, I ended up purchasing this Domain from DreamHost, thus making them my Domain Name Registrar. Makes sense, right?\nA Domain Name Registrar is just a company or organization that manages the registration of internet domain names (like google.com or example.org) on behalf of individuals and businesses.\nWell, I eventually received an E-Mail congratulating me of being the new owner of deenzcan.com and I was presented with an inconceivable list of services and storages and routing options my new registrar offered me. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to do any of those things, it really was just about securing the name but then, I vaguely remembered the Netlify UI\u0026hellip;there was something about it. Something about a field talking about how I can substitute the ugly suffix-ed Netlify URL with my own if I had acquired such a thing.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t hurt to have a quick look, huh. And so I quickly rolled out their documentation. Familiarized with the process and it seemed more daunting in the moment than anything else. I know what a DNS is or at least, what its job is in the grand scheme of things. What I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too familiar with were the various types of DNS records that could exist all belonging to the same IP address.\nNow, the necessary configuration didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too scary in and of itself but what bothered me was the fact that I could just as well host this little static site myself. And not have to rely on Netlify to hold all my files. And before considering what kind of time investment that might carry, I had \u0026ldquo;just another little glimpse\u0026rdquo; into some online articles.\nThe next obstacle presented itself soon enough. Being tied to this horrendous apartment complex, access to my router\u0026rsquo;s configs and the option of port forwarding, thus exposing a port of my machine to the outside world were not feasible. Nor did I want to crawl back to some hosting platform again, now that I put this idea into my head. So, the third option I have found seemed quite intriguing. Cloudfare\u0026rsquo;s Tunneling Service which they provided free of charge.\nAlright, I thought. Can\u0026rsquo;t be too hard. Cloudflare is a reputable company (in some regards less than others), they surely have some accessible documentation and and UIs to work with. And they did, actually. I suppose the fact that I don\u0026rsquo;t know what half the options within my dashboard are for is moreso a sign of my own lack of competence rather than one of Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s lack of accessability but I read up on everything regarding tunneling in the context of exposing your host machine to the world (securely, of course) and was excited to get this done and over with, as intrigued as I was. And considering it was already past 2am.\nTunneling refers to creating a secure connection that makes your locally-running application accessible over the internet, bypassing the need for traditional web hosting services. Instead of uploading your code to a hosting platform, you run your application on your own computer (localhost) and use a tunneling service to create a public URL that forwards traffic to your local machine. It\u0026rsquo;s like creating a temporary bridge from the internet directly to your development environment.\nExcept, next problem. I can\u0026rsquo;t use tunneling without having moved my domain from DreamHost to Cloudflare and having the NameServer entries point at them instead. Before that though, I was also supposed to turn off DNSSEC at my old provider because otherwise I could run into issues regarding DNS resolving.\nDNSSEC creates a secure domain name system by adding cryptographic signatures to existing DNS records. These digital signatures are stored in DNS name servers alongside common record types like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, etc. By checking its associated signature, you can verify that a requested DNS record comes from its authoritative name server and wasn’t altered en-route, opposed to a fake record injected in a man-in-the-middle attack.\nWell, I promptly forgot about the last part but eagerly went through the rest of the onboarding process which was rather self exaplantory. I had moved my domain to Cloudflare within minutes or rather, I just switched out the old NS entries with the ones Cloudflare provided me with. That should have been enough, in theory to get started with the process of tunneling.\nDNS records are instructions stored in the Domain Name System that tell computers how to handle requests for a particular domain. They\u0026rsquo;re like a phone book that translates human-readable domain names into various types of network information.\nIn regards to that, I want to briefly note the steps down in such a way that I have undergone them to get this domain and the various subdomains onto the world wide web. I still haven\u0026rsquo;t slept. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel so good. I need to find a solution to get rid of all these grammatical errors. Whatever\u0026hellip;\nA Step by Step guide for how to set up a tunnel through Cloudflare to expose one of your localhost ports that\u0026rsquo;s currently serving a website # Install cloudflared Log into your Cloudflare account after cloudflared tunnel login opens a browser window Create a new tunnel with `cloudflared tunnel create \u0026lt;TUNNEL_NAME\u0026gt; This should also create a credential file at ~/.cloudflared/\u0026lt;TUNNEL_ID\u0026gt;.json Create a config.yml inside ~/.cloudflared/ tunnel: my-smut-site credentials-file: /home/sneedroot/.cloudflared/\u0026lt;TUNNEL_ID\u0026gt;.json ingress: - hostname: www.sneedsite.com service: http://localhost:8080 - service: http_status:404 Set up the dns record for your exposed subdomain via cloudflared tunnel route dns romm romm.deenzcan.com Run the tunnel Either temporarily through `cloudflared tunnel run romm` Or as a persistent systemd service (if you\u0026rsquo;re using systemd) sudo cloudflared service install GOOD JOB YOU DID IT\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some odd fascination seeing your website be publicly available just like all the other 3 slop sites you cycle through regularly. I am still very much enthralled.\nNow there are obviously security concerns you have to take into considerations. Cloudflare has an honestly impressive plethora of free options and configurations available with which you can play.\nBut I am mainly interested in solving as much on my end as possible. I\u0026rsquo;ve spun up a Kali container to poke around a bit and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot that can be improved. I will get to that over the next couple days.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re exposing ports serving things you haven\u0026rsquo;t secured or written yourself you probably want to implement security posthaste! That being said, whilst engrossed in that rush, I decided to also host some other services through Docker on several subdomains that I got locked down via Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s access policy. The plan is to use WireGuard as a VPN and reverse proxies for everything but my blog to reject any access that isn\u0026rsquo;t me or me-approved. But I was crashing out too hard for that today\u0026hellip;.heh\u0026hellip;\nI am still a novice when it comes to containerization despite having to write image build pipelines on a daily basis for my job lol but I think I have learned more about the process last night than I have in my time on the job rip. I might share my compose file once it it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more sensible.\nI have set up a small variety of other things and butted my head and quite a few other problems last night but I suppose I can embellish on those some other time. This is getting way too long already.\nOH YEAH, I didn\u0026rsquo;t forget my self-imposed task from yesterday either. Funnily enough, I realized that KaTeX was already implemented.\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t} \\]\nUtterly based. And also, the About section is done. Well\u0026hellip;done. I am not really done with it. But I have written enough to be satisfied for now.\nAs to what I want to have finished by the next time I visit here? Ideally a self-hosted E-Mail server so I can spam people with from my shiny @deenzcan.com address hehehe.\n","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/6c0e79fdab42-i-am-tired-boss....-part-1-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"A glimpse into Self-Hosting while I am simultaneously losing it.","title":"I am tired boss...","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/personal/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Personal","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/the-site/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"The-Site","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/this-site/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"This Site","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tutorial/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tutorial","type":"tags"},{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t really write.

Things have gotten quite dire with my life and me and as of recently, my singular source of interpersonal communication that is not work-related has been\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;terminated\u0026quot;.\nAnd I feel like things will take a very depressing turn if I don\u0026rsquo;t at least pretend I am talking with someone\u0026hellip;about something. Even if I won\u0026rsquo;t get any replies, just as fine with me. And that\u0026rsquo;s, for the most part, why I am trying to at least dump some thoughts on this site. They will likely be about technical projects or things I want to explore more rather than about personal things, that\u0026rsquo;s what therapists are for amirite.\nBut I also hope that, having written those things down, will give me a clearer and more structured image as to what I want to do in my free time and how to approach it. Because, god knows, I am currently jumping from one stimulant-infused 4-nights-no-sleep bender into the next after well some well deserved 20 hour naps inbetween. And that\u0026rsquo;s not really a lifestyle my body will tolerate for long. Plus, I am starting to doubt I am even that productive after the first 40 hours lol. If I remember correctly, I have tried to set up a basic first article around 20 times before giving up because my perfectionist mind was always displeased with SOMETHING. Even now, it bothers me that I haven\u0026rsquo;t configured the KaTeX plugin even if I don\u0026rsquo;t have any purpose for it.\nIn addition to those primary reasons, another major incentive was for me getting more into the world of self-hosting services. A Kavita instance I am running locally and that I would like to access from outside has gotten me interested in the idea. Even this website, running currently on Netlify should ideally be hosted by yours truly. I should bite the bullet and buy some more hardware finally.\nAnyways, a small static website seemed like a good fit from which to gradually branch out over time. I also want to have a place where I potentially rant about tech stuff or even showcase personal pet projects I have been and will be working on. I got a lotta stuff cookin'.\nFor my own peace of mind I want to keep a slow but steady curve when it comes to upgrades on this site. My focus for tomorrow:\nLaTeX support Simple About page I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what else to say at this moment, maybe I will get better at this whole writing-thing over time.
