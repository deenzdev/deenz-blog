Surely somewhere among these thousands of data center DNS queries there must be some unique entry pointing right at you. It\u0026rsquo;s over for you, kid.\nBut that aside, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason someone should be here other than me. Regardless, if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this\u0026hellip;I appreciate it. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I have many chances to talk or or be heard as cringe as that may sound. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s one of those basic human needs everyone takes for granted, that SHOULD be taken for granted maybe. I don\u0026rsquo;t really know. I\u0026rsquo;ll stop whining for now. :^)\nAnyway, let\u0026rsquo;s get to it!\nAbout me, for real tho # My name is Dennis and I\u0026rsquo;m some random 28 year old from the Internet gainfully employed as a Backend Software Engineer\u0026hellip;or Developer, if you have a horse in that race.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to think that I am a relatively laid back kinda fella. I don\u0026rsquo;t take myself too seriously and I hope I am somewhat self-aware as well? I am not so sure anymore these days.\nSome other shrimple facts about me:\nI love marine critters of all kinds, especially the cetacean ones contrary to that, I very much like to go fishing when the mood strikes me I am playing the piano at a semi-amateur level, getting a lot more practice in recently I like to travel whenever I get the chance, I used to at least\u0026hellip;and the current list of countries I have been to at one point or another comprises: Italy, USA, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand, Australia, UK, Poland and surely some other EU shithole I can\u0026rsquo;t remember I overuse profanity\u0026hellip;. I am easily made to be excited about a topic if I sense the other to be excited about it I tend to rotate through a slowly growing list of subjects that interest me, picking up where I left off last time usually including such things as Cryptography, Nuclear Engineering, Marine Biology, Geology\u0026hellip; ,Kaijiu movies, the field of Military aviation, Linguistics, reading genre-fiction slop, reading highbrow Literature, Digital Signal Processing. I guess I should mention Computer Science as well, huh\u0026hellip;meh\u0026hellip; Nah, just kidding. I am genuinely passionate about a metric fuckton of CS related topics. From Data Science to DevOps to Computer Hardware Architecture, File Transfer Protocols and Reverse Engineering. As long as it\u0026rsquo;s not some pesky UI shit I am likely into it. (Not to say I can\u0026rsquo;t appreciate a well designed Interface, it just won\u0026rsquo;t be designed by me lol).\nI have spent too many years of my adult life denying myself that excitement of tech thinking that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly dare to fall into this stereotype of being the quiet, lonely loser who OF FUCKING COURSE works in IT. But after embracing it, I can say that I have finally found an appropriate outlet for a lot of aimlessness I have experienced before.\nAt this point I should probably point out that I have no degree in this field. God knows how I survived high school. Any current and future career success I can proudly attribute to a whole lot of\u0026hellip;luck, I guess. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But I won\u0026rsquo;t question it. God\u0026rsquo;s plan!\nHmmm, what else is there\u0026hellip; I suppose I can insert some corny Favorites section just to fill the Table of Contents (do I have that even enabled?!). Keep in mind, this is not a be-all-end-all selection\u0026hellip;just whatever feels right in this very moment which is also why I am not spending any time elaborating on those choices. That and I am too lazy rn\u0026hellip;\nFavorites # Musician # Lil Darkie # Notable tracks:\nfly away door right now SWAMP REVOLVER COLLOSSAL CONFLICT Book (series) non-fiction # Computer Systems: A Programmer\u0026rsquo;s Perspective # Outro (for now) # I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel like continuing this right now!! But I have already written up more than I initially expected. So you should be grateful, witless visitor. Maybe I can make it a weekly habit to add some more information that isn\u0026rsquo;t too indidentifiable but then again, at the time of writing I have my name plastered on the front page so who\u0026rsquo;s the real nimrod?! Anyways\u0026hellip;\nCYA! :^)\nTO BE CONTINUED \u0026hellip;ok, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll play around with the shortcodes quickly that this framework supplies\u0026hellip;\nUh oh bros...

But one thing led to another. My thoughts started to wander to places best left buried for now. (Hahaha, I miss her, bros\u0026hellip;) So, I had to distract myself whilst waiting for wagie hour to begin again.\nThus, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a little glimpse (strictly for future planning) into how much domains go for these days. Can\u0026rsquo;t hurt to familiarize myself with these things, two weeks ago I had never even thought about running something as pitiful as a blog ha! Well, turns out\u0026hellip;this shit is dirt cheap.\nAs you can hopefully see, non-existant reader\u0026hellip;I had to go for it. There was no other option\u0026hellip;and so one thing led to another. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to describe the Odysee that followed to the best of my ability but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to reconstruct the exact steps. I will also note down explanations for a few terms, mostly for myself. That\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a reoccurring thing.\nEssentially, I had very little idea how long the whole process would take nor did I have any specific plans to actually utilize this domain for the forseeable future but 4,99/year is hard to beat. Well, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s actually easy to beat. It\u0026rsquo;s truly crazy how cheap these things are.\nSo, I ended up purchasing this Domain from DreamHost, thus making them my Domain Name Registrar. Makes sense, right?\nA Domain Name Registrar is just a company or organization that manages the registration of internet domain names (like google.com or example.org) on behalf of individuals and businesses.\nWell, I eventually received an E-Mail congratulating me of being the new owner of deenzcan.com and I was presented with an inconceivable list of services and storages and routing options my new registrar offered me. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to do any of those things, it really was just about securing the name but then, I vaguely remembered the Netlify UI\u0026hellip;there was something about it. Something about a field talking about how I can substitute the ugly suffix-ed Netlify URL with my own if I had acquired such a thing.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t hurt to have a quick look, huh. And so I quickly rolled out their documentation. Familiarized with the process and it seemed more daunting in the moment than anything else. I know what a DNS is or at least, what its job is in the grand scheme of things. What I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too familiar with were the various types of DNS records that could exist all belonging to the same IP address.\nNow, the necessary configuration didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too scary in and of itself but what bothered me was the fact that I could just as well host this little static site myself. And not have to rely on Netlify to hold all my files. And before considering what kind of time investment that might carry, I had \u0026ldquo;just another little glimpse\u0026rdquo; into some online articles.\nThe next obstacle presented itself soon enough. Being tied to this horrendous apartment complex, access to my router\u0026rsquo;s configs and the option of port forwarding, thus exposing a port of my machine to the outside world were not feasible. Nor did I want to crawl back to some hosting platform again, now that I put this idea into my head. So, the third option I have found seemed quite intriguing. Cloudfare\u0026rsquo;s Tunneling Service which they provided free of charge.\nAlright, I thought. Can\u0026rsquo;t be too hard. Cloudflare is a reputable company (in some regards less than others), they surely have some accessible documentation and and UIs to work with. And they did, actually. I suppose the fact that I don\u0026rsquo;t know what half the options within my dashboard are for is moreso a sign of my own lack of competence rather than one of Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s lack of accessability but I read up on everything regarding tunneling in the context of exposing your host machine to the world (securely, of course) and was excited to get this done and over with, as intrigued as I was. And considering it was already past 2am.\nTunneling refers to creating a secure connection that makes your locally-running application accessible over the internet, bypassing the need for traditional web hosting services. Instead of uploading your code to a hosting platform, you run your application on your own computer (localhost) and use a tunneling service to create a public URL that forwards traffic to your local machine. It\u0026rsquo;s like creating a temporary bridge from the internet directly to your development environment.\nExcept, next problem. I can\u0026rsquo;t use tunneling without having moved my domain from DreamHost to Cloudflare and having the NameServer entries point at them instead. Before that though, I was also supposed to turn off DNSSEC at my old provider because otherwise I could run into issues regarding DNS resolving.\nDNSSEC creates a secure domain name system by adding cryptographic signatures to existing DNS records. These digital signatures are stored in DNS name servers alongside common record types like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, etc. By checking its associated signature, you can verify that a requested DNS record comes from its authoritative name server and wasn’t altered en-route, opposed to a fake record injected in a man-in-the-middle attack.\nWell, I promptly forgot about the last part but eagerly went through the rest of the onboarding process which was rather self exaplantory. I had moved my domain to Cloudflare within minutes or rather, I just switched out the old NS entries with the ones Cloudflare provided me with. That should have been enough, in theory to get started with the process of tunneling.\nDNS records are instructions stored in the Domain Name System that tell computers how to handle requests for a particular domain. They\u0026rsquo;re like a phone book that translates human-readable domain names into various types of network information.\nIn regards to that, I want to briefly note the steps down in such a way that I have undergone them to get this domain and the various subdomains onto the world wide web. I still haven\u0026rsquo;t slept. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel so good. I need to find a solution to get rid of all these grammatical errors. Whatever\u0026hellip;\nA Step by Step guide for how to set up a tunnel through Cloudflare to expose one of your localhost ports that\u0026rsquo;s currently serving a website # Install cloudflared Log into your Cloudflare account after cloudflared tunnel login opens a browser window Create a new tunnel with `cloudflared tunnel create \u0026lt;TUNNEL_NAME\u0026gt; This should also create a credential file at ~/.cloudflared/\u0026lt;TUNNEL_ID\u0026gt;.json Create a config.yml inside ~/.cloudflared/ tunnel: my-smut-site credentials-file: /home/sneedroot/.cloudflared/\u0026lt;TUNNEL_ID\u0026gt;.json ingress: - hostname: www.sneedsite.com service: http://localhost:8080 - service: http_status:404 Set up the dns record for your exposed subdomain via cloudflared tunnel route dns romm romm.deenzcan.com Run the tunnel Either temporarily through `cloudflared tunnel run romm` Or as a persistent systemd service (if you\u0026rsquo;re using systemd) sudo cloudflared service install GOOD JOB YOU DID IT\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some odd fascination seeing your website be publicly available just like all the other 3 slop sites you cycle through regularly. I am still very much enthralled.\nNow there are obviously security concerns you have to take into considerations. Cloudflare has an honestly impressive plethora of free options and configurations available with which you can play.\nBut I am mainly interested in solving as much on my end as possible. I\u0026rsquo;ve spun up a Kali container to poke around a bit and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot that can be improved. I will get to that over the next couple days.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re exposing ports serving things you haven\u0026rsquo;t secured or written yourself you probably want to implement security posthaste! That being said, whilst engrossed in that rush, I decided to also host some other services through Docker on several subdomains that I got locked down via Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s access policy. The plan is to use WireGuard as a VPN and reverse proxies for everything but my blog to reject any access that isn\u0026rsquo;t me or me-approved. But I was crashing out too hard for that today\u0026hellip;.heh\u0026hellip;\nI am still a novice when it comes to containerization despite having to write image build pipelines on a daily basis for my job lol but I think I have learned more about the process last night than I have in my time on the job rip. I might share my compose file once it it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more sensible.\nI have set up a small variety of other things and butted my head and quite a few other problems last night but I suppose I can embellish on those some other time. This is getting way too long already.\nOH YEAH, I didn\u0026rsquo;t forget my self-imposed task from yesterday either. Funnily enough, I realized that KaTeX was already implemented.\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t} \\]\nUtterly based. And also, the About section is done. Well\u0026hellip;done. I am not really done with it. But I have written enough to be satisfied for now.\nAs to what I want to have finished by the next time I visit here? Ideally a self-hosted E-Mail server so I can spam people with from my shiny @deenzcan.com address hehehe.\n","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/6c0e79fdab42-i-am-tired-boss....-part-1-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"A glimpse into Self-Hosting while I am simultaneously losing it.","title":"I am tired boss...","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/personal/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Personal","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/the-site/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"The-Site","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/this-site/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"This Site","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tutorial/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tutorial","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/dev/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Dev","type":"categories"},{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t really write. I don\u0026rsquo;t really write at all. I barely even communicate. So I apologize in advance if this comes off as somewhat \u0026ldquo;all over the place\u0026rdquo;. Things have gotten quite dire with my life and me and as of recently, my singular source of interpersonal communication that is not work-related has been\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;terminated\u0026quot;.\nAnd I feel like things will take a very depressing turn if I don\u0026rsquo;t at least pretend I am talking with someone\u0026hellip;about something. Even if I won\u0026rsquo;t get any replies, just as fine with me. And that\u0026rsquo;s, for the most part, why I am trying to at least dump some thoughts on this site. They will likely be about technical projects or things I want to explore more rather than about personal things, that\u0026rsquo;s what therapists are for amirite.\nBut I also hope that, having written those things down, will give me a clearer and more structured image as to what I want to do in my free time and how to approach it. Because, god knows, I am currently jumping from one stimulant-infused 4-nights-no-sleep bender into the next after well some well deserved 20 hour naps inbetween. And that\u0026rsquo;s not really a lifestyle my body will tolerate for long. Plus, I am starting to doubt I am even that productive after the first 40 hours lol. If I remember correctly, I have tried to set up a basic first article around 20 times before giving up because my perfectionist mind was always displeased with SOMETHING. Even now, it bothers me that I haven\u0026rsquo;t configured the KaTeX plugin even if I don\u0026rsquo;t have any purpose for it.\nIn addition to those primary reasons, another major incentive was for me getting more into the world of self-hosting services. A Kavita instance I am running locally and that I would like to access from outside has gotten me interested in the idea. Even this website, running currently on Netlify should ideally be hosted by yours truly. I should bite the bullet and buy some more hardware finally.\nAnyways, a small static website seemed like a good fit from which to gradually branch out over time. I also want to have a place where I potentially rant about tech stuff or even showcase personal pet projects I have been and will be working on. I got a lotta stuff cookin'.\nFor my own peace of mind I want to keep a slow but steady curve when it comes to upgrades on this site. My focus for tomorrow:\nLaTeX support Simple About page I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what else to say at this moment, maybe I will get better at this whole writing-thing over time. Maybe not. :^) Cya!\n","date":"4 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/a670dacb96c2-i-m-here....and-ya-ll-there/","section":"Posts","summary":"Just a short stream of thoughts as to why I am here and why this site exists in the first place.","title":"I'm here....and ya'll there!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
